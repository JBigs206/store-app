# store-app

I created this website as a way to get more practice using .NET Framework along with practicing mobile first design and DRY coding principals. 

The tech stack used for this project is Bootstrap 4 and .NET Framework 4.7.

This project is also using Fake Store API (https://fakestoreapi.com/) for the data calls.

However, I wanted to set it up as close as possible to how I would set the site up using calls to a SQL database by creating a separate Service file to make the API calls.

Remaining tasks for this project:

- Create Cart View along with items in cart.
- Add image zoom when hovering over product image to allow user to see items more closely.
- Add ability to search the data through the navbar.
